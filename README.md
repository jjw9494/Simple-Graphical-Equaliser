This was my first attempt at creating a fully realised application using C++. I began learning C++ as a way to better understand the lower level processes abstracted away in languages like Javascript and to understand different paradigms like Object Oriented and Functional programming, as well as concepts like memory management, pointers and classes.

I wanted to take on a project that would allow me to practice these skills and having been making electronic music my whole life I was really excited to start building audio plugins and look forward to learning and creating more experimental musical applications in the future.
